## Story: 

You are clearly the best toy.

However, other toys are trying to steal your thunder, eliminate them so you'll stay on the top shelf!

## Controls:

Drag your mouse and release to launch your toy into other toys, if you hit them hard enough, they will die. Try to survive as long as possible.

## Inspiration:

This is part of a Series where I make one Game every month. Toy story meets fun physics!
