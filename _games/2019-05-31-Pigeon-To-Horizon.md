## Story: 

This pigeon is trying to reach the other side of the ocean, little does he know there's no end... 

## Controls:

Arrow keys  or touch to move left or right

## Inspiration:

This is part of a Series where I make one Game every month. This is a simple endless runner where I tried my hand at random generation and a clear visual style.
